Jai Hind everyone, welcome to this repository of our team for task 2 of BDCOE.

API DOCUMENTATION - https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/30426278/2s9YRGxUhL

The core idea behind our project is to create an attendance manager for any organisation where admin can provide access to the users and update their attendance,
while the users can check their attendance and updates shared by the admin.

As of now we have decided to use dart/flutter for the basic frontend of the app, and NodeJS,Express,MongoDB and firebase for the backend.

OUR TEAM:

App Developers- Manas Srivastava, Kartik Kumar

Backend Developer- Mohit Singh
